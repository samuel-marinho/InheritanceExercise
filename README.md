# OOP Exercise:

This Java program allows users to register product data and generate corresponding price tags for each product, considering different categories such as common, used, and imported products.
This exercise is a example to demonstrate object-oriented concepts in Java, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, while addressing a practical scenario of labeling products with different characteristics.

## Program Features:

### Product Registration:

Users can enter the number of products they want to register.
For each product, the program prompts for the following information:
Type of product (common, used, or imported).
Product name.
Product price.

After registering all products, the program generates price tags for each of them.
The tags include:
Product name.
Total price, considering specific features (such as customs fees for imported products).
Additional details, like the manufacturing date for used products.

### Code Structure Improvements:

Use of inheritance: The program utilizes inheritance to create the Product, ImportedProduct, and UsedProduct classes, providing a more organized and reusable structure.

### Program Usage:

The user initiates the program and provides the number of products to be registered.
For each product, data such as type (common, used, or imported), name, and price are entered.
The program generates price tags considering the specific characteristics of each product category.
The tags are displayed to the user, allowing them to visualize all relevant information for each product.
